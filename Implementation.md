## COSC 360 - Detailed Implementation of Project


## Basic Overview & Programming Languages/Frameworks Used

Cointalk utilizes an array of modern frameworks and programming languages. Our front end application is built with React. 
This allows us to use components, which creates options for code reusability and easy implementation of common elements like headers, nav bars etc. 
The individual components make use of basic HTML syntax such as <div>, <a>, <p> while the design of those components use SCSS.
SCSS is utilized to use advanced styling choices that CSS may not provide.

## 1. Docker compose/images (I can do this later)
